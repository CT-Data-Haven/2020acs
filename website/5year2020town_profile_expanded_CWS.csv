See definitions below for more information. All other data are from the US Census Bureau ACS 5-year estimate. The ACS surveys a sample of households on a rolling monthly basis; survey data are aggregated and averaged into 1 and 5-year period estimates. The Census Bureau considers the 5-year estimates to be the most accurate and recommends using 5-year estimates for town-level data.","'MoE' is the Margin of Error for each estimate. Due to sampling methodology, margins of error exist for all reported survey estimates. For Wellbeing data, the maximum margin of error applies when the observed percentage is 50%. The margin of error shrinks as the percentage approaches the extremes of 0% or 100%. The maximum margin of error has a 95% confidence interval. See https://ctdatahaven.org/reports/datahaven-community-wellbeing-survey for more information on the survey methodology. For all other data, margins of error represent the 90% confidence interval for estimates. With 90% confidence, each estimate falls between a lower limit (subtracting margin of error from estimate) and an upper limit (adding margin of error to estimate).  \n'Hispanic Population' includes all persons who identify as of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. 'White Non-Hispanic Population' includes all persons who identify as of white or Caucasian race, and not of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.
