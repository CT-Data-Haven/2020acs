# 2020 ACS update + community profiles

Distribution-ready files are in [`to_distro`](to_distro). CSV file for populating website's community profiles is in [`website`](website).

## Output

```{r comment=""}
files <- data.frame(file = paste(".", list.files(c("fetch_data", "output_data", "to_distro", "website"), full.names = TRUE), sep = "/"))

print(data.tree::FromDataFrameTable(files, pathName = "file"))
```


## Development

Call `make` to rerun scripts in the proper order. I'll move the global year variables (`yr` and `cws_yr`) to the makefile soon.
